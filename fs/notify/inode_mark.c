/*
 * fsnotify inode mark locking/lifetime/and refcnting
 *
 * REFCNT:
 * The mark->refcnt tells how many "things" in the kernel currently are
 * referencing this object.  The object typically will live inside the kernel
 * with a refcnt of 2, one for each list it is on (i_list, g_list).  Any task
 * which can find this object holding the appropriete locks, can take a reference
 * and the object itself is guarenteed to survive until the reference is dropped.
 *
 * LOCKING:
 * There are 3 spinlocks involved with fsnotify inode marks and they MUST
 * be taken in order as follows:
 *
 * entry->lock
 * group->mark_lock
 * inode->i_lock
 *
 * entry->lock protects 2 things, entry->group and entry->inode.  You must hold
 * that lock to dereference either of these things (they could be NULL even with
 * the lock)
 *
 * group->mark_lock protects the mark_entries list anchored inside a given group
 * and each entry is hooked via the g_list.  It also sorta protects the
 * free_g_list, which when used is anchored by a private list on the stack of the
 * task which held the group->mark_lock.
 *
 * inode->i_lock protects the i_fsnotify_mark_entries list anchored inside a
 * given inode and each entry is hooked via the i_list. (and sorta the
 * free_i_list)
 *
 *
 * LIFETIME:
 * Inode marks survive between when they are added to an inode and when their
 * refcnt==0.
 *
 * The inode mark can be cleared for a number of different reasons including:
 * - The inode is unlinked for the last time.  (fsnotify_inode_remove)
 * - The inode is being evicted from cache. (fsnotify_inode_delete)
 * - The fs the inode is on is unmounted.  (fsnotify_inode_delete/fsnotify_unmount_inodes)
 * - Something explicitly requests that it be removed.  (fsnotify_destroy_mark_by_entry)
 * - The fsnotify_group associated with the mark is going away and all such marks
 *   need to be cleaned up. (fsnotify_clear_marks_by_group)
 *
 * Worst case we are given an inode and need to clean up all the marks on that
 * inode.  We take i_lock and walk the i_fsnotify_mark_entries safely.  For each
 * mark on the list we take a reference (so the mark can't disappear under us).
 * We remove that mark form the inode's list of marks and we add this mark to a
 * private list anchored on the stack using i_free_list;  At this point we no
 * longer fear anything finding the mark using the inode's list of marks.
 *
 * We can safely and locklessly run the private list on the stack of everything
 * we just unattached from the original inode.  For each mark on the private list
 * we grab the mark-> and can thus dereference mark->group and mark->inode.  If
 * we see the group and inode are not NULL we take those locks.  Now holding all
 * 3 locks we can completely remove the mark from other tasks finding it in the
 * future.  Remember, 10 things might already be referencing this mark, but they
 * better be holding a ref.  We drop our reference we took before we unhooked it
 * from the inode.  When the ref hits 0 we can free the mark.
 *
 * Very similarly for freeing by group, except we use free_g_list.
 *
 * This has the very interesting property of being able to run concurrently with
 * any (or all) other directions.
