	  Say Y here if you want to connect this type of camera to your
	  computer's USB port. See <file:Documentation/video4linux/se401.txt>
	  for more information and for a list of supported cameras.

	  This driver uses the deprecated V4L1 API and will be removed in
	  2.6.39, unless someone converts it to the V4L2 API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called se401.
