	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADIS16260 ADIS16265
	  programmable digital gyroscope sensor.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called adis16260.

	tristate "Analog Devices ADIS16251 Digital Gyroscope Sensor SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices adis16261 programmable
	  digital gyroscope sensor.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called adis16251.
