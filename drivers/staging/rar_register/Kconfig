	---help---
	  This driver allows other kernel drivers access to the
	  contents of the restricted access region control registers.

	  The restricted access region control registers
	  (rar_registers) are used to pass address and
	  locking information on restricted access regions
	  to other drivers that use restricted access regions.

	  The restricted access regions are regions of memory
	  on the Intel MID Platform that are not accessible to
	  the x86 processor, but are accessible to dedicated
	  processors on board peripheral devices.

	  The purpose of the restricted access regions is to
	  protect sensitive data from compromise by unauthorized
	  programs running on the x86 processor.
