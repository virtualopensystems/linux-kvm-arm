TODO:

1. A per-device/tty port context required to support multiple devices
on same platform.

2. REMOVE the sysfs entry PID passing mechanism, since there should
be a better way to request user-space to install line discipline.

3. Re-view/Re-work on the locking.

4. Re-structure to make the ldisc driver more generic for chipsets which mux
multiple connectivity (BT, FM, GPS) upon 1 TTY port.

5. Step up and maintain this driver to ensure that it continues
to work.  Having the hardware for this is pretty much a
requirement.  If this does not happen, the will be removed in
the 2.6.35 kernel release.

Please send patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>.
